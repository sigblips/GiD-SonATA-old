    <h1>Open SonATA Installation Guide</h1>

    <h2>Minimum Hardware requirements</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>At least 2 64-bit processors with sse3 capability</li>
        <li>4 GB memory</li>
        <li>64-bit OpenSuSE 11.3 is the recommended Linux distribution. OpenSuSE 11.1 will also work for development, but 11.3 is currently what we are developing with.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Minimum software necessary</h2>

    <p>If you are installing a fresh install of Linux, the standard install is recommended except:

    <ul>
	    <li>Select Gnome desktop
	    <li>No AppArmor
	    <li>No multimedia software
	    <li>No office software
	    <li>No graphics software
	    <li>Add XFCE
	    <li>Add basic development
	    <li>Add kernel development
	    <li>Add C/C++ development
    </ul>


    <h2>Package dependencies</h2>

	<b>SonATA is known to build with the specified versions:</b>

	<p>These packages should be available from the Linux Distribution. Install them if appropriate.
    <BR>

		<ul>
            <li>gcc 4.3.3 or 4.5.2
            <ul>
                <li>Note about the version of GCC compiler to use: We are currently using GCC version 4.5.2. We standardize on this GCC version to avoid introducing unknown variations in our system. We have only tested GCC versions 4.3.3 and 4.5.2. Versions previous to version 4.3.3 are discouraged. Any GCC version > 4.3.3 will quite possibly work, but we can not support this. Use of GCC version 4.3.3 or 4.5.2 is highly recommended. All GCC versions can be obtained from <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html" target="_other">gcc.gnu.org/releases.html</a>.</li>
            </ul></li>

		    <li>Java JDK, version 5 or 6. See <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jdk5-jsp-142662.html" target="_other">www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jdk5-jsp-142662.html</a> or <a href="https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u23-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer" target="_other">cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u23-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer</a>for JDK download details.</li>
		    <li>mysql server, see <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" target="_other">dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> for download details, or the linux distribution will contain a recent enough version. NOTE: MySQL is oly necessary if you are running the seeker program (you'll learn about the seeker in subsequent documentation) in a mode that requires the catalog of available observation targets. You will only need to do this in advanced mode.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>These get installed by running the script <b>&quot;script/get_packages&quot;</b> from the SonATA directory. Run this script once to install these:
        
        <ul> 
		    <li>swig 1.3.31</li>
		    <li>expect 5.44.1.15</li>
		    <li>gnu readline 5.2</li>
	        <li>ACE 5.7.8</li>
	        <li>fftw 3.2.1</li>
	        <li>xtail 2.1</li>
	        <li>tcl 8.5.7</li>
        </ul>

	<p>Optional packages. It is suggested you do not worry about these until you are advanced enough with the software to understand how to use them. Also, one of the project goals is to furhter documentation in this area.

    <ul>
        <li>doxygen 1.2.10 (creating automated documentation)</li>
	    <li>stlport 4.6.2 (debugging STL related problems)</li>
	    <li>pp3, tex, ImageMagick (for making starmaps)</li>
	    <li>Apache Tomcat 5.0.28 (If you wish to build and run the SonATA build interface)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Download, Build, and Install the SonATA software. </h2>

        <h3>Download</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Create a fork of the &quot;setiQuest/SonATA&quot; project.</li>
            <li>You need to have Git installed on your computer. Refer to the instructions in GitHub.com for proper Git usage and operation.</li>
            <li>Clone your fork onto your local computer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Build and Install</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Build CppUnit
                <ul>
		            <li>% cd CppUnit</li>
		            <li>% ./reconfig --prefix /usr/local/CppUnit</li>
		            <li>% make check</li>
		            <li>% sudo make install</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>sse-pkg	(single host environment or sse host)
                <ul>
			        <li>% cd sse-pkg</li>
			        <li>% ./reconfig</li>
			        <li>% make</li>
			        <li>% make install</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
		    
            <li>sig-pkg
			    <ul>

			        <li>% make</li>
			        <li>% make install</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>



    <p>Your environment must be set up correctly for proper operation:

    <ul>
        <li>If you are running bash, add this to your .bashrc:
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you are running csh, add this to you .cshrc:
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You must allow your account to run sudo without having to enter a password:
        <ul>
            <li>as root, edit /etc/sudoers</li>
            <li>Add the following entry: &quot;<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL&quot;, where <user> is the user name of the account you will run SonATA.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Install a version of the .sserc file in your home directory:

        <ul>
            <li>% cp <gitroot>/OpenSonATA/sse-pkg/util/example.sserc.tcl ~/.sserc</li>
            <li>Note that you MUST specify the location of the tclreadline 9.9.0 shared library in order for the seeker's tcl interpreter to find it.  You can do this by uncommenting appropriate line in your .sserc file:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>#lappend ::auto_path /usr/lib</li>
                <li>#lappend ::auto_path /usr/local/lib</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


   <h2>Running SonATA</h2>

	1. Install a version of the .sserc file in your home directory:

		% cp <gitroot>/OpenSonATA/sse-pkg/util/example.sserc.tcl ~/.sserc

	Note that you MUST specify the location of the
	tclreadline 9.9.0 shared library in order for the seeker's tcl
	interpreter to find it.  You can do this by uncommenting
	appropriate line in your .sserc file:

		#lappend ::auto_path /usr/lib
		#lappend ::auto_path /usr/local/lib

	2. Additions to your shell rc file

	Update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

	setenv $ACE_ROOT /usr/local/ACE_wrappers
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$ACE_ROOT/ace:$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

	Update your PATH:

	setenv PATH "~/sonata_install/bin:$PATH"

	In order to run SonATA, the stacksize must be changed to unlimited.
	The following command should be added to your shell rc file.

		limit stacksize unlimited

	3. Use the 'runsse.sh' script to start things up,
	e.g., to run in all-simulator mode type:

		% runsse.sh 

	You can also use 'runsse.sh -help' to see all
	the startup options.

	4. If you want to use the sse with the mysql database, here's
	how to set it up:

	% mysqladmin create sonata_iftest
	% mysql sonata_iftest < sse-pkg/database/seeker.schema

	5. There are several optional environment variables that can
	be used to override the default locations for various files:

	SSE_INITRC - seeker startup file.
   	Default: ~/.sserc

	SSE_SETUP - directory of config files.
   	Default: ~/sse_install/setup

	SSE_ARCHIVE - directory root for created data files.
   	Default: ~/sse_archive

	6. Other environment variables that can override program
	configuration defaults:

	SSE_DEBUG_LOG_MAX_FILESIZE_MEGABYTES
   	Default: 25

	CONTROL_COMPONENTS_TSCOPE_HOST
   	Default: seeker host
	
	CONTROL_COMPONENTS_ANT_CONTROL_HOST
   	Default: antcntl.atarray.org
	
	CONTROL_COMPONENTS_PDM_ARCHx_HOST
   	Default: seeker host
	
	RUNSSE_FONT
	Default: 9x15
